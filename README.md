About JsonPowerDB:


JsonPowerDB is a Real-time, High Performance, Lightweight and Simple to Use, Rest API based Multi-mode DBMS. JsonPowerDB has ready to use API for Json document DB, RDBMS, Key-value DB, GeoSpatial DB and Time Series DB functionality. JPDB supports and advocates for true serverless and pluggable API development.


Benefits of using JsonPowerDB

1. Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
2. Schema-free, Simple to use, Nimble and In-Memory database.
3. It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
4. It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
5. It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost.

Illustrations:


JSON objects are surrounded by curly braces {}. JSON objects are written in key/value pairs. Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid JSON data type (string, number, object, array, boolean or null). Keys and values are separated by a colon.


Scope of Functionalities:

JsonPowerDB (JPDB) is Next Generation, Creative and Disruptive Multi-mode DBMS_ with many USPs.
1. Proprietary algorithm for High Performance CRUD operations. Multiple times faster than popular DBMS.
2. Serverless support for faster development - A UI developer can develop complete dynamic application.
3. DBMS with built in web / application server and embedded caching makes the performance lightning fast.
4. Server side Native NoSQL - best query performance.
5. In-built support to query on multiple JPDB databases.
6. Multi-mode DBMS - Document DB, Key-Value DB, RDBMS support.
7. Schema free - easy to develop and maintain.
8. Web-services API - Can be used with any programming language that has support for HTTP.
9. Enriched by a pluggable API Framework - A developer can develop a pluggable API and plugin into any of our cloud JPDB instance.
10. Standardisation of API development framework makes the development process easy, more readable, and less error prone.
11. Multiple security layers.
12. Nimble, Simple to use, In Memory, Real-time DBMS.
